# SECURE-CODE
Financial Access Risk Analysis - Secure Code Hackathon
 Project Overview
The Financial Access Risk Analysis project is designed to automate the detection of Segregation of Duties (SoD) violations in ERP systems, specifically focusing on Oracle Fusion. The solution processes ERP system data and generates detailed reports highlighting conflicting roles and entitlements, helping organizations reduce the risk of fraud, errors, and unauthorized access.
Key Features:
Automated detection of SoD conflicts.
Deterministic algorithm ensuring consistent results.
Dockerized solution for portability and reproducibility.
Efficient handling of large datasets with optimized performance.
Easy-to-interpret output reports for compliance teams.

This solution processes user-role mappings, privilege assignments, and SoD rules using optimized role-based access control (RBAC) logic and high-performance data structures. The implementation is fully Dockerized, allowing seamless execution with no modifications required by the evaluator.

Core Concepts
 Segregation of Duties (SoD)
SoD ensures that no individual can perform both critical actions in a business process, reducing the risk of fraud and unauthorized activities.
Example:
Leg 1: Create Payables Invoices
Leg 2: Approve Payables Invoices
If the same user has both entitlements, it creates a conflict and raises a security red flag.
 Key Data Components
1.Entitlements:
oPermissions granted to users, groups, or roles to access specific features.
oStored in XX_FUSION_SOD_MST and XX_FUSION_9_ENT_MST tables.
2.Privileges:
oSpecific actions a user can perform, bundled into duty roles.
oStored in XX_FUSION_7_PVLGS_MASTER and mapped using XX_FUSION_6_PVLG_TO_ROLE.
3.Roles:
oGroups of privileges assigned to users.
oDefined in XX_FUSION_4_ROLE_MASTER_DETAILS and mapped through XX_FUSION_3_USER_ROLE_MAPPING.
4.Users:
oIndividuals with access rights based on assigned roles.
oStored in XX_FUSION_2_USER_DETAILS
                                                    

Features
Deterministic Algorithm: Produces the same output for the same input, ensuring consistency.
Optimized RBAC Engine: Efficiently expands role hierarchies and privilege mappings.
Fast Conflict Detection: Uses hash-based lookup tables to speed up SoD violation detection.
Dockerized Execution: The solution is containerized to ensure portability across environments.

 Setup and Execution Instructions

3.1 Prerequisites
Before running the solution, ensure you have the following installed:
Docker Desktop (Windows, Linux, or macOS)
